 *
 * Test checks whether good "knocked" positions are returned on getMovementPositions invocation.
 * It is safe to assume that 4x4 board is sufficient to fulfill all possible scenarios with a board numerated like this:
 * |    0   |   1   |   2   |   3   |
 * |    4   |   5   |   6   |   7   |
 * |    8   |   9   |   10  |   11  |
 * |    12  |   13  |   14  |   15  |
 *
 * Due to simple movement definition the only position tested are corners and one from the middle:
 * - corners: 0,3,12,15
 * - middle: 9
